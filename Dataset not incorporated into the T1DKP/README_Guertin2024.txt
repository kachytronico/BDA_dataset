survey_results_and_results.final.xlsx - contains survey data/questionnaire and summary of genetic risk for 3818 participants;542 at "high genetic risk".

assay_final_genotyping_files.xlsk - SNPs that had high performance metrics across batches of samples with individual genotyping data are included, with elimination of 10 SNPs, representing those that correspond to Supplementary Table S1. The individual GRSs for each individual were obtained using all SNPs, so that the GRS computed from Table S1 SNPs may differ in magnitude from those obtained from the total SNP panels and listed in the output file. 
	value -9 (rs12927355, rs1367728, rs72727394, and rs9585056) corresponds to blanks in the file
